      "message": "Thanks for the contribution!  Looks good.  Would be nice to have a unit test, but really the planar functions need more complete tests.\nIn the future there is P010 that is equivalent to NV12 but 10 bit and P410 is like NV24 with 4:4:4 subsampling.\nAlso NV42 is the same as NV24 but VU vs UV, which doesnt matter, but you might provide a macro in the header",
