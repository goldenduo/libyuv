      "message": "It\u0027s for the GYP build system where we have no way to set a flag for a subset of source files.\n\nI did some search on the Internet and they told me to create a separate static library (something like libyuv_lsx) to work around the issue.  But here we want a standalone libyuv.a archive, and this approach did not include the content of libyuv_lsx.a into libyuv.a, so I guess we cannot use it.  Thus I have to work it around with the #pragma magic.\n\nIt\u0027s not needed in the public headers, should I remove it from libyuv.gypi then?",

      "message": "top 3 concerns\n1. gyp is deprecated.  we removed support but on request added it back in, but its unsupported.  Unless its important to lsx/lasx, i\u0027d suggest making support just use the common code.\n\n2. the attribute tends to clash with compile options and different compilers.  if a user builds with conflicting build options (e.g. -mno-lsx) the command line wins and the attribute can produce a fatal build error, requiring a code change\nfor arm/x86 the assembly doesnt usually need a build option, but the usual intrinsics approach is to break up library by build options.  It complicates the build files, but you likely want to do that for the important builds.  in chrome thats GN/Ninja/SISO.\nNote that libyuv currently has unresolved build errors relating to attribute target for sme, so its disabled on most builds.\nNote 2 heads up that I plan to add bazel.\nI\u0027ll counter propose removing libyuv.gyp\n\n3. if this file needs to exist, it should be either integrated into an existing header, such as cpu_support.h or moved to an internal folder\nbut I\u0027d only advice either if it is necessary for GN/Bazel/Cmake",
