      "message": "Gemini claims these fmov may be a bug?\n\nThese fmov instructions only clear the lower 32 bits of the z registers, but the following usdot instructions operate on the full vector width. usdot accumulates, so the destination registers should be zeroed out entirely before use.\n\nThe previous implementation used movi vXX.8h, #0, which correctly zeroed the full z register.\n\nPlease consider using an instruction that zeros the entire vector, for example dup z16.s, wzr.",
