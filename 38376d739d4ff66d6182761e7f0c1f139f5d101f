      "message": "Jordan, I think the question here is if we need to keep the `Version` in this file in sync with https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/libyuv/include/libyuv/version.h of if that is not required.\n\nThis is a libyuv way to express its code version but Chromium cares about the git commit in the DEPS file.\n\nhttps://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/libyuv/include/libyuv/version.h is more of a way for libyuv to say \"you need at least version XXX\" and it might not be increased with all the commits.",
