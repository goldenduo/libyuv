      "message": "I got the impression from documentation that __ATOMIC_RELAXED comes from gcc and is supported by llvm but not msvc? \n\nMy Windows machine has msvc but not ninja, so my only ability to build is CMake/make, but they\u0027re defaulting to GCC.  So I can\u0027t locally test solutions yet.\nI would put a #error here to see if the atomic is used.\n\nReguardless, the link error appears to be from outside libyuv... a bad dependency?",
